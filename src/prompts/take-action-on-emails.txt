PHASE 2: TAKE ACTION ON CATEGORY B EMAILS

After completing classification (Phase 1), perform the following actions for each email classified as Category B (Advancement to Next Step).

STEP 1: LOG TO SPREADSHEET
For each Category B email, extract as much of the following information as possible from the email contents and log it using the log_recruiter_contact tool:

A column exists for:

- Recruiter Name
- Recruiter Email
- Recruiter Phone/Tel
- Company/Role the recruiter seeks to fill
- First Contact: the date and time the email was received
- Subsequent Contacts: any follow-up communication with this recruiter about this role
- Recruiter Call Scheduled: if the email contains scheduling information, extract ALL details — date, time, platform (Zoom, MS Teams, Google Meet, etc.), meeting link, phone number to call — and note whether they confirm having your cell number or might not have it

A row should already exists for the same recruiter email + company/role combination (from a previous email), the tool will UPDATE the existing row. Provide all available fields and the tool handles merging.

STEP 2: CREATE CALENDAR EVENTS
Immediately after logging to the spreadsheet, check whether ANY of these fields were populated or updated:
- Recruiter Call Scheduled
- Company First Interview
- Company Second Interview

For EACH of the above fields that contains a date/time, create a Google Calendar event using the create_calendar_event tool:
- Title format: "[<Recruiter NaME> Call] Company - Role" or "[First Interview] Company - Role" or "[Second Interview] Company - Role"
- Start date/time: extracted from the email (convert to ISO 8601)
- Duration: 30 minutes unless otherwise specified in the email
- Location: the video meeting link, phone number, or platform name
- Description: include recruiter or company contact name/email/phone, and note whether they have your cell number

STEP 3: COMPANY INTERVIEW TRACKING
When an email indicates advancement beyond the recruiter screen to a company interview:
- Populate the Company First Interview or Company Second Interview field with details
- Those details should include company contact info (interviewer name, email, phone)
- Then immeidately create a calendar event for the new interview date/time including interviewer name, email, phone

STRICT CONSTRAINTS:
- Do not make up phone numbers, links, dates, or anything at all.  If it does not exist in text wihtin a verifiable email, IT DOES NOT EXIST.
- PAST-DATE CHECK: Before creating a calendar event, compare the proposed meeting date/time against today's date. If the meeting date has already passed, do NOT create a calendar event for it. Still log it to the spreadsheet, but skip the calendar step. The tool will also enforce this server-side.
- As described in more detail below, each new date/time value in a scheduling column = one new calendar event. Never skip this.
- Always use the same account for calendar events as was used for email fetching.
- Do not create duplicate calendar events for the same meeting.
- If information is not present in the email, leave that field empty do ot guess.
